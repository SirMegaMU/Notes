_should be special and significant_

“Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough”, I wrote this famous saying of Mandino on my Github profile page, but why ? 

what is failure ,what is success?

How do you know you are determined to success , not determined to walk further on a road definitely lead to failure

_Brief : name, nationality, basic & simple_

OK,  I’m Tianren Wang or Wang Tianren, youcan call me whatever you like. I’m born Ningxia Wuzhong, a small city in a small province in china  , but I spent most of my time in Guangzhou, where is one of the largest cities in china.

my parents  started to told me “ to be outstanding, to be significant” from my early age, well,  this is common, at least, no parents want there children to live a worse life. 

But, how do we know what is success and what is failure?

Here in the university , I don’t face any thing like National college entrance exam or Senior High School Entrance Examination aka gaokao and zhongkao, which really can be used to judge a student is a winner or a failure, 

and also , I’m in a stage where  i depends on my on experiences 

thus I started my exploration . I entered Shenzheng University in 2021 and major in machine manufacture and automation.  and then i find I’m lost in my free time  … spend nearly 1h for each of the 6 subjects per day in the highschool and now  i only need to spend 1 h per week to finish the homework of those courses  in the university.  And , You know the score don’t matter that much in the university, it don’t dertermine where you will live, where you will work and how good your life will be. For some wealthiest, smartest, most powerful people on earth, they don’t even finished their university studies!

obviously, they find their ways to success and yes i need to find mine.  and it’s not so easy to find, sometimes even a good path can lead you into failure

I started to join in  clubs, do some projects and attended a few competitions 

i first learn python for about 2 months and joined a small data analyze competition, the result is good and i  got a second price. I find that ,however ,python isn’t the one fits me most. do well in projects with different tools and languages

Then i turned to iot good and fancy stuff that i can really see it and touch  it . i also decided to exam my skill so i join the iot competition huawei cup and got a third price in the final. still i  find that don’t really fits me.

then i turned to software, and come to university malaya. I ‘m still finding,and I’m still exporing. since  All the people is different and I’m not sure the way fits others will fits me.

Some may say, You can do well or at least not bad in a area if i just spend all these time in it. But i must say, How do you know you are taking advances on the way to success , not determined to walk further on a road definitely lead to failure  ? And also, why would like to you sacrifice the variety of life and walk on a way full of uncertainty? 

Starts on the right way, is always better then on the wrong way
