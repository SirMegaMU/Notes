In the Russia-Ukraine War, the permanent neutral county Switzerland adopted sanctions imposed by the EU against Russia. Switzerland has previously only put in place sanctions created by the United Nations Security Council. Many countries and people claim that the sanction is not neutral, while the president of Switzerland declare it as a Switzerland type of neutral. But and the rights and duties of neutral countries which have already written in Convention de La Haye, proofed neutral countries can be “unneutral”

# Main point
