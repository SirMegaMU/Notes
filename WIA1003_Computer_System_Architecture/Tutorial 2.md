# Tutorial 2

## 1

- CPI = 1.55
- MIPS rate = 51.61 MIPS
- execution time = 0.0019

# 2

CPI = 2.5

MIPS rate = 40 MIPS

# 3

- a 

  p' = (p*(clock frequency of P'))/(clock frequency of P)=p *1.5

- b
  - Memory bottleneck
  - Instruction dependencies

# 4

T_exec_A/T_exec_B = 500/600

# 5

code 2 is faster

CPI for code 1 is 2, for code 2 is 1.5
