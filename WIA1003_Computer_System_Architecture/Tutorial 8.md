# Tutorial 8

1. The typical elements of a machine instruction include:
   - Opcode: The operation code that specifies the type of operation to be performed.
   - Operands: The data or memory locations on which the operation is to be performed.
   - Addressing mode: Specifies the method used to determine the location of the operands.
   - Control bits: Additional bits that control specific features or options of the instruction.

2. Source and destination operands can be held in various locations, including:
   - Registers: High-speed storage elements within the processor itself.
   - Memory: Locations in the main memory of the computer system.
   - Immediate values: Constants or data values that are part of the instruction itself.

3. If the instruction contains four addresses, each address may serve a different purpose, such as:
   - Source operand addresses: Specify the locations of the operands to be used for the computation.
   - Destination operand addresses: Indicate where the result of the computation should be stored.
   - Intermediate operand addresses: Represent temporary storage locations or intermediate results needed for complex computations.
   - Control addresses: Point to memory locations or control structures related to branching, looping, or other control flow operations.

4. Five important instruction set design issues are:
   - Instruction formats: The structure and organization of instructions, including the number and size of fields.
   - Addressing modes: The methods used to specify the location of operands, such as immediate, direct, indirect, or indexed addressing.
   - Data types and sizes: The types and sizes of data that can be processed by the instructions, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or characters.
   - Instruction types: The categories or classes of instructions provided by the instruction set, such as arithmetic, logical, control, or data transfer instructions.
   - Instruction set complexity: The balance between simplicity and expressiveness of the instruction set, taking into account factors like ease of programming, performance, and hardware complexity.

5. The difference between an arithmetic shift and a logical shift is:
   - Arithmetic shift: In an arithmetic shift, the sign bit (most significant bit) is preserved, and the vacant bit positions are filled with copies of the sign bit during the shift. This ensures that the sign of the value remains intact, making it suitable for signed numbers.
   - Logical shift: In a logical shift, the sign bit is not preserved, and the vacant bit positions are filled with zeros during the shift. This shift is suitable for unsigned numbers and does not consider the sign bit.

6. Transfer of control instructions, such as jumps or branches, are needed to alter the sequential flow of program execution. They allow the program to change the order of instructions and redirect the execution to different locations based on specific conditions or program logic. Transfer of control instructions are essential for implementing loops, conditional statements, function calls, and other program control structures.

7. Instructions for performing X = (A + B - C)/(D - E * F) on different machines:
   - One-Address Machine:
     ```
     LOAD A
     ADD B
     SUB C
     STORE T1
     LOAD D
     LOAD E
     MUL F
     SUB T1
     DIV T2
     STORE X
     ```
   - Two-Address Machine:
     ```
     MOVE A, R1
     ADD B, R1
     SUB C, R1
     STORE R1, T1
     MOVE D, R2
     MOVE E, R3
     MUL F, R3
     SUB R3, R1
     DIV R2, R1
     MOVE R1, X
     ```
   - Three-Address Machine:
     ```
     MOVE A, R1
     ADD B, C, R2
     SUB D, E, R3
     MUL R3, F, R4
     SUB R2, R4, R5
     DIV R5, R1, R6
     MOVE R6, X
     ```

   - Logical right shift (4 bits): 00001010
   - Logical left shift (4 bits): 11100000
   - Arithmetic right shift (4 bits): 11111011 (preserves the sign bit)
   - Arithmetic left shift (4 bits): 11100000 (preserves the sign bit)
   - Right rotate (4 bits): 01101011
   - Left rotate (4 bits): 10111010
