General categories of function specified by computer instructions:

- Arithmetic and Logic: Perform mathematical calculations and logical operations.
- Data Transfer: Move data between memory, registers, and I/O devices.
- Control Transfer: Alter the flow of program execution, such as branching and jumping.
- Input/Output: Interact with peripheral devices for input and output operations.
- Special Operations: Perform specific tasks like system calls, interrupts, and privileged instructions.

- Fetch: In this state, the instruction is fetched from memory into the instruction register (IR). The program counter (PC) is incremented to point to the next instruction to be fetched.
- Decode: In this state, the fetched instruction is decoded to determine the operation to be performed and identify any operands or addressing modes required.
- Read Operand: If the instruction involves reading data from memory or registers, this state involves fetching the required operands or data from the specified sources.
- Execute: In this state, the actual execution of the instruction takes place. The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs the necessary calculations or logical operations based on the instruction and the operands.
- Memory Access: If the instruction involves accessing memory to read or write data, this state is responsible for performing the memory access operation.
- Write Back: In this state, the results of the execution or any updated data are written back to the appropriate destination, such as registers or memory locations.
- Control Transfer: Instructions that involve control transfer, such as branching or jumping, may have a state dedicated to handling these operations. This state updates the program counter to the new target address based on the instruction's conditions or branching conditions.

Polling: Polling is an approach to dealing with multiple interrupts where the processor periodically checks each interrupt request line to determine which device requires service. It involves sequentially checking each device in a predetermined order for pending interrupts. The processor polls each device by querying their status or interrupt flag to identify if an interrupt has occurred. Once the interrupt is detected, the processor suspends its current operation and jumps to the interrupt service routine (ISR) specific to that device. Polling can be implemented using a loop or through interrupt priority schemes. However, polling can introduce latency if the processor doesn't check a device with a pending interrupt immediately, and it can be inefficient if many devices are being polled continuously.

Interrupt-driven: Interrupt-driven is another approach to handling multiple interrupts, where each device has an interrupt request line connected to the processor. When a device needs attention, it asserts its interrupt line, causing the processor to temporarily halt its current operation and handle the interrupt. The processor then acknowledges the interrupt, saves the current execution context, and jumps to the corresponding ISR to service the interrupt. Interrupt-driven systems use interrupt controllers to manage and prioritize multiple interrupts. This approach allows the processor to respond promptly to interrupts as they occur, reduces latency, and efficiently handles multiple devices with minimal impact on the main execution flow. Interrupt-driven systems require proper interrupt handling and prioritization mechanisms to ensure fairness and timely response to different interrupt sources.

1. Increased Bandwidth: Multiple buses allow for parallel data transfers, enabling concurrent communication between different components of the system. This results in increased overall bandwidth, as multiple data transfers can occur simultaneously. It helps to avoid data bottlenecks and improves system performance, especially in scenarios where there are high data transfer requirements.
2. Reduced Contention and Improved Efficiency: In a single-bus architecture, multiple components must contend for access to the shared bus, leading to potential conflicts and delays. With multiple buses, different components can use separate dedicated buses, reducing contention and enabling efficient data transfers without waiting for other devices to complete their transfers. This helps in minimizing idle time and improving overall system efficiency.
3. Enhanced Scalability: Multiple-bus architectures provide scalability advantages, as additional buses can be added to accommodate increasing demands for data transfer. It allows for the expansion of the system without putting excessive load on a single bus, thereby maintaining efficient communication between various components.
4. Support for Different Data Types and Operations: Multiple-bus architectures can provide dedicated buses for specific types of data or operations. For example, separate buses can be used for instruction fetching, data transfers, and I/O operations. This segregation allows for optimized routing and efficient utilization of the available buses based on specific requirements, resulting in improved overall system performance.
5. Simultaneous Access to Memory and I/O: With multiple buses, it is possible to have separate buses dedicated to memory access and I/O operations. This allows for simultaneous data transfers between memory and I/O devices, enabling more efficient I/O operations and reducing bottlenecks associated with accessing shared resources.

In contrast, an asynchronous bus transfers data without relying on a central clock signal to coordinate the timing. Each device connected to the bus operates independently, initiating and completing data transfers based on their own internal timing mechanisms. The sender device controls the timing of the data transmission, while the receiver device independently handles the data when it arrives. The timing between the sender and receiver is not strictly synchronized, allowing for more flexibility in accommodating devices with different operating speeds and handling asynchronous events or delays.

Advantages of an Asynchronous Bus:

1. Flexibility: An asynchronous bus offers more flexibility in accommodating devices with varying speeds or operating characteristics. It allows devices to operate independently and transfer data at their own pace, eliminating the need for strict synchronization with a centralized clock. This flexibility is particularly useful when integrating components with different clock domains or when dealing with devices that may have varying latencies.
2. Reduced Power Consumption: Asynchronous communication can be more power-efficient compared to synchronous communication. By eliminating the need for a global clock signal that continuously operates, devices in an asynchronous bus can dynamically adjust their power consumption based on their activity. This can result in energy savings, especially in scenarios where certain devices may be idle or operating at slower speeds.
3. Timing Flexibility: Asynchronous buses can handle variations in timing and delays more effectively. They can adapt to different propagation delays, latencies, and varying response times from devices. This makes them more tolerant to variations in device characteristics and helps ensure robust communication even in the presence of timing uncertainties.
4. Reduced Clock Skew: Clock skew, which refers to the variation in arrival times of the clock signal across different components, is a concern in synchronous systems. Asynchronous buses eliminate the need for a centralized clock, reducing the impact of clock skew on overall system performance and timing constraints.

Maximum data transfer rate = (2 bytes / 250 ns) × (1 second / 1,000,000,000 ns) = 2 / (250 × 1,000,000,000) bytes/s

Simplifying the expression: Maximum data transfer rate = 2 / 250,000,000 bytes/s = 8 × 10^-9 bytes/s
