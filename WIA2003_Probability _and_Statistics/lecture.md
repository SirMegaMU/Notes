# Bayes' Theorem

Reversed Probability

> from the result to the reason

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\\
P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A_i)}{\sum_jP(B|A_j)P(A_j)}
$$

Bayes theorem deals with **sequential** events, whereby new additional information is obtained for a subsequent event, and that new information is used to revise the probability of the initial event. 

- Prior probability 

  is an initial probability value originally obtained before any additional information is obtained. 

-  Posterior probability

   is a probability value that has been revised by using additional information that is later obtained.
